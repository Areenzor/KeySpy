## **Overview**

Keyspy is a cross-platform, modular, and encrypted keylogger. It offers robust logging capabilities and is designed for use cases like:
- Ethical penetration testing.
- Research in cybersecurity.
- Education in secure application development.

---

## **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites
Before installing Keyspy, ensure you have:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/keyspy.git
   cd keyspy
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up the project:
   ```bash
   python setup.py install
   ```

---

## **Configuration**

Keyspy uses a YAML configuration file for customization. The default configuration file is located at `config/default.yaml`.

### Example Configuration
```yaml
logging:
  level: INFO
  file_path: logs/keyspy.log
encryption:
  enabled: true
  key: "your-secure-encryption-key"
network:
  upload_endpoint: "https://yourserver.com/api/upload"
  retry_attempts: 3
  timeout: 30
```

### Key Parameters
- **`logging.level`**: Sets the logging level (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`).
- **`encryption.key`**: Encryption key for securing logs.
- **`network.upload_endpoint`**: Endpoint for remote log uploads.

To use a custom configuration file:
```bash
keyspy --config path/to/your-config.yaml
```

---

## **Usage**

### Running the Keylogger
Start Keyspy from the command line:
```bash
keyspy --config config/default.yaml
```

### Command-Line Arguments
| Argument              | Description                           |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `--config`            | Path to the configuration file       |
| `--export`            | Export logs to a specified format    |
| `--format`            | Format for exported logs (`csv`, `json`, `xml`) |

---

## **Exporting Logs**

Export logs to a specific format:
```bash
keyspy --export --format json
```

Supported formats:
- `csv`: Comma-separated values
- `json`: JavaScript Object Notation
- `xml`: Extensible Markup Language

Exported logs are stored in the `exports/` directory by default.

---

## **Extending Keyspy**

Keyspy's modular design allows developers to add custom functionality. 

### Example: Adding a Plugin
1. Create a Python file in the `plugins/` directory.
2. Implement your functionality using the provided hooks.
   ```python
   from keyspy.core import register_plugin

   @register_plugin
   def custom_plugin(log_entry):
       # Process log_entry
       print(f"Custom log: {log_entry}")
   ```

3. Update the configuration file to load your plugin:
   ```yaml
   plugins:
     - custom_plugin
   ```

---

## **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues
- **No logs generated**:
  - Check if the logging path is writable.
  - Verify the application has necessary permissions.
- **Encryption errors**:
  - Ensure the encryption key matches across sessions.
- **Network upload failure**:
  - Verify the remote endpoint URL and network connectivity.

---

## **Testing**

Keyspy includes a robust test suite. Run tests with:
```bash
pytest
```

### Code Coverage
To check code coverage:
```bash
pytest --cov=keyspy
```

---

## **Ethical Guidelines**

Using Keyspy comes with significant ethical responsibilities:
- Obtain explicit written consent before deployment.
- Never use Keyspy in unauthorized environments.
- Ensure compliance with local laws and organizational policies.
